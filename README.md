# Maze Follower with Turtlebot and Gazebo
## Summary

To have a simulated robot to solve a maze and convert the solution into a path to follow. Using ROS to simulate path following with Turtlesim and Gazebo. Starts with the Maze Generator to create a random maze with a solution path. The solution path is saved as a set of coordinates and the Maze itself is saved as a PNG file. To minimize ROS errors and crashes, the coordinates are reformatted to run more smoothly with Gazebo and Turtlebot. The reformations does not change the shape of the path. The PNG goes through Map2Gazebo to create a world with a 3D maze. The final output of this whole intergration is a robot, we chose Burger, to follow the solution path of the maze.
