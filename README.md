# Maze Follower with Turtlebot and Gazebo
## Summary

To have a simulated robot to solve a maze and convert the solution into a path to follow. Using ROS to simulate path following with Turtlesim and Gazebo. Starts with the Maze Generator to create a random maze with a solution path. The solution path is saved as a set of coordinates and the Maze itself is saved as a PNG file. To minimize ROS errors and crashes, the coordinates are reformatted to run more smoothly with Gazebo and Turtlebot. The reformations does not change the shape of the path. The PNG goes through Map2Gazebo to create a world with a 3D maze. The final output of this whole intergration is a robot, we chose Burger, to follow the solution path of the maze.

### Maze Generator

Stared from the [baseline maze code]( https://github.com/tonypdavis/PythonMazeGenerator) found in Github and credited to Davis MT. With modifications to intergrate with our project, the Maze Generator will be the first Python file to be called. The needed modules are : pygame, time , and random        





ros stuff


gazebo stuff

## Notes

if py game does not work this code can still function by giving the function points as shown in "maze solution"
